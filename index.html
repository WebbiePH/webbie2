    <h2>Webbie: Hello World! (05/29/2020)</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">I bought <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/" target="_blank">The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery</a> course in Udemy last year, October 2019. This course
      is from Andrei Neagoie. His profile said he is, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the instructor of the highest rated Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.‚Äù Sounds promising. However, I never got to start it until about April of 2020. I find it
      very engaging, and I‚Äôm happy I got this course. We also have our own Discord forum where you can post questions, be updated on announcements, and learn other tidbits. You can also interact with fellow students, with Andrei, and other
      developers. What you will essentially learn:</p>
    <img src="Images\ztmoutline.png" alt="ztm outline" width="560" height="315">
    <p style="text-align:justify">I just got through the first part of the course. We tackled the fundamentals ‚Äì understanding how the internet works, etc. - and HTML 5. I have links in the <a href="videos1.html" target="_blank">Videos</a> and <a
        href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> page for these. Rather than discussing each HTML tag, we focused on the more importannt ones. We can always look-up the tags in the HTML references, as needed. The challenge at the end of
      the section was to create my own website. I thought why not document what I am learning here and put it on a website! So here we are. I‚Äôll be writing articles regarding my understanding of the lessons and my progress. Besides, sharing what you
      know helps in the learning process. The sections I can think of now are:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> (links to references, courses)</li>
      <li><a href="projects.html" target="_blank">Projects</a> (What's kept or keeping us busy. üòä)</li>
      <li><a href="tools.html" target="_blank">Tools</a> (IDEs, etc)</li>
      <li><a href="videos1.html" target="_blank">Videos</a> (inspirational videos, my own videos, etc.)</li>
      <li><a href="articles.html" target="_blank">Articles</a> (my own articles)</li>
      <li><a href="aboutme.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> (my online resume)</li>
			<li><a href="contactus.html" target="_blank">Reach out</a> (over beer? coffee? whatever works.)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">I have gone ahead and thought of a domain name. My choices are:
    <ol>
      <li>Webbie.ph (still available)</li>
      <li>Webbie.it (still available)</li>
      <li>Webbie.com (still available)</li>
      <li>Webbie.io (already for sale for USD 299)</li>
    </ol>
    I am not about to spend USD 299 (~PHP 15000) for this so option #4 is no longer a question. I am torn between choices 1,2, and 3. They all very good choices for me. Let‚Äôs see, as the course progresses, which will come out as the winner. I hope
    the domain name fees are reasonable. </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">I learned in Andrei‚Äôs course that in web development you have the backend, front-end, and full stack types of developers. Front-end is mainly dealing with what users ‚Äì you‚Äôll be talking mostly about HTML, CSS, and
      Javascript. Backend, on the other hand, is mostly dealing with the server part of the process. When you say ‚Äúfull stack‚Äù, you are dealing with the whole spectrum ‚Äì from frontend to backend.</p>
    <img src="Images\fullstack.png" alt="fullstack diagram" width="560" height="315">
    <p style="text-align:justify">We can view a much more detailed discussion of the web development spectrum in a roadmap video from Andrei. I have only watched the first part- mostly about frontend development. He will cover backend in part 2.
      Here‚Äôs the link to the video. He‚Äôs showing a mind map on the video and discusses each point. He highlights what to focus on among the many branching areas. After watching the video, I can‚Äôt wait to know more about javascript. It also showed
      links to the many tools and libraries that are available for developers so they can make beautiful, functional websites.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify">To end today‚Äôs lessons, I took the HTML quiz from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp" target="blank">W3 School</a> Got 90% score! I didn‚Äôt know some of the tags but it really helped that the course
      taught where we can find more information. I even learned more during the quiz. I also went ahead and took exercices from W3 School‚Äôs sites as supplemental learning. I learned additional elements and attributes which I used in this article.
    </p>
    <img src="Images\htmlquiz.png" height="315" width="560" alt="html quiz results">
    <p style="text-align:justify">In a span of just 2 weeks, I have learned a lot. I am on a slow pace as I also have a day job. However, as the course progresses, I become more excited on what's to come. So, on to the next one!</p>
